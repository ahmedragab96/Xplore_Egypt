Every inch in the place represents the Nubian culture; the walls, the rooms, the passage and the food as well . You will find countless activities to enjoy at the Anakato hotel ; a boat ride to discover the river Nile‘s mysteries, sand boarding, a camel ride, Nubian folklore, natural therapies like sand burial to cure various diseases such as rheumatism and rheumatoid arthritis and masks which will leave your skin silky smooth.",

It consists of 3 Nubian houses (Wer, Owy and Toski) characterized by the colorful decorations illustrating the Nubian civilization. Everything in the place is different! The amazing Nile view hugged by the desert gives you a great chance to isolate yourself from the daily hectic routine and just enjoy the tranquility and nature. Every inch in the place represents the Nubian culture; the walls, the rooms, the passage and the food as well . You will find countless activities to enjoy at the Anakato hotel ; a boat ride to discover the river Nile‘s mysteries, sand boarding, a camel ride, Nubian folklore, natural therapies like sand burial to cure various diseases such as rheumatism and rheumatoid arthritis and masks which will leave your skin silky smooth.",
