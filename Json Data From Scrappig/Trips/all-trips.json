After picking you up from your hotel in Hurghada, we will drive to Luxor in an air-conditioned deluxe vehicle through lush farmland and sugar plantations to edge of the desert where you will find the tombs of the pharaohs in the Valley of the Kings.\r\n\r\nCutting directly into the mountains, the tombs were filled with treasures and covered in beautifully-painted hieroglyphics depicting the life of the king they housed. Your guide will bring the stories to life as you explore the tombs before continuing to the impressive mortuary Temple of Queen Hatshepsut.\r\n\r\nArchitecturally stunning, the Temple of Queen Hatshepsut contains beautiful murals on its inner walls. On our return to Luxor’s East Bank, we will visit the Colossi of Memnon – two gigantic statues that stand proudly, yet virtually alone at the entrance to what was Amenhotep III’s mortuary temple.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, we continue on to visit the famous Karnak Temple – the largest place of worship that was ever built. Its ancient name Ipet-isut means “the most sacred of places.” The temple, or, more correctly, the complex of temples, was built more than two thousand years ago by generation after generation of pharaohs. Within the complex, the great “Hypostyle Hall” is an incredible forest of giant pillars.",

Following a meet up with your guide, who will provide all necessary equipment, you will enjoy a local dive to get orientated, before heading to the Lara wreck, Jackson Reef, and the Sinai Peninsula.\r\n\r\nYou can receive instruction tailored for beginners, and for those with more experience. Depending on your skill level, swim through schools of fish to a spot where sharks often gather. Proceed toward the wreck Yolanda to reach a plateau 15-25 meters (50-80 feet) deep, scattered with small ergs and coral outcrops where stone fish and scorpion fish feed. The wreck of the Yolanda, complete with its cargo of toilets and baths, provides home to big fish, such as tuna, bluefish, and the occasional hammerhead.\r\n\r\nAnother popular dive site is Jackson Reef on the northernmost of the 4 reefs that separate the Sinai and Saudi Arabia. Strong currents make it ideal for large pelagic, sharks and other big fish. Admire soft and hard coral, and look for barracudas, jacks, hammerheads, and tiger sharks.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the Cypriot merchant ship Lara, which collided with the reef in 1981, lies at depths of 45 meters (147 feet) and more, while the wreck of the SS Thistlegorm holds World War II machinery and equipment, still neatly stowed in its open holds, making for a fantastic dive experience.\r\n\r\nThis most famous Sinai Peninsula dive has to be experienced to truly appreciate its wonders. The group of coral heads at Temple come up from a depth of 12-20 meters (40-65 feet). If viewed in the right position, and using your imagination, they look like columns of a temple.\r\n\r\nFor a less challenging dive, there are sandy patches at about 8 meters (25 feet) with lots of inlets into the shore reefs, and coral heads about 2 meters (6.5 feet) apart, allowing you to swim between them.",

It’s still a bit of a mystery as to how the pyramids were constructed and how long they took to complete, but there’s no question that the pyramids still represent the pinnacle of ancient Egyptian architectural accomplishments.

You'll also be treated to a local lunch! Pyramids, Sphinx, and lunch? Oh my! \r\n\r\nThe day starts by seeing the guardian of the necropolis, the Sphinx (you know, the one with the missing nose!), which stands in front of the second Pyramid of Khepren. Enter the Giza Plateau from the Sphinx Gate to beat the crowds to the site, and after seeing the Sphinx, walk to the mysterious great pyramid of King Cheops, where you can marvel at the sheer size of the construction, and try and formulate your own theories as to how it was built. \r\n\r\nThe Pyramids tour continues to the second Pyramid of Giza, which is the second largest and the only pyramid that still caries part of its original casing. From there, continue to the third and the smallest of the Giza Plateau pyramids. And no visit to the Pyramids of Giza would be complete without stopping at the panoramic view point where you get to see the all the pyramids of Giza in the one spot (and take a photo like the ones you see in travel books – free of tourists! Well, almost…) \r\n\r\nLeaving the amazing pyramids behinds, head back out to the streets of Cairo and stop by a local restaurant for lunch.
