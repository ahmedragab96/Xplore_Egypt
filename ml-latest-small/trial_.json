This is an archeological paradise with its wealth of pharaonic temples and is considered a gateway to Valley of the Kings.\r\n\r\nValley of the Kings: There are actually 2 valleys: the East Valley, where the majority of the royal tombs and temples were constructed; and the West Valley. In all there are approximately 65 tombs and chambers located in this burial site for the major kings of the new Egyptian dynasty. Your visit includes entry into 3 tombs. If you wish to see either the tomb of Tutankhamun or Ramses 6, there is an additional ticket fee.\r\n\r\nTemple of Hatshepsut: Visit the Hatshepsut Temple, named for the Foremost of Noble Ladies. Queen Hatshepsut was the fifth pharaoh of the 18th dynasty of ancient Egypt and the daughter of King Thutmose I. She established the first world trade network and her temple is considered one of the most important temples of ancient times.\r\n\r\nThe Colossi of Memnon: Before lunch, you\u2019ll visit the Colossi of Memnon, the 2 massive stone statues of Pharaoh Amenhotep III. For the past 3,400 years (since 1350 BC), the statues have stood in the Theban necropolis as guardians at the entrance to Amenhotep\u2019s memorial temple. The statues are made from blocks of quartzite stone.\r\n\r\nLunch:Your guide will escort the group to a 4-star restaurant to have lunch and a chance for some rest before the afternoon tour.\r\n\r\nTemple of Karnak: This complex was originally dedicated to god Amun Ra, his wife Mut and son Khons. Later, around 30 additional kings added their own touches to the complex. The site is vast, covering nearly 1 mile by 2 miles in area with more than 20 temples in all. What makes the Karnak Temple complex special is that it includes several of the finest examples of ancient Egyptian design and architecture, such as the Hypostyle Hall, one of the world\u2019s great architectural achievements of all time and the Temple of Amun, a spectacular forest of giant papyrus-shaped columns.\r\n\r\nShopping: At the end of the day, you\u2019ll be able to spend about an hour shopping for Egyptian antiques.

From the top of the High Dam you can gaze across Lake Nasser to the Kalabsha temple in the south and the huge power station to the north.\r\n\r\nContinue to the Unfinished Obelisk in the granite quarries of Aswan, where much of the red granite used for ancient temples and colossi came from. The Unfinished Obelisk still lies where it was carved when a crack was discovered as it was being hewn from the rock. Your qualified Egyptologist guide will explain how the 1 tonne obelisk was carved, and why the crack caused it to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe last of the 3 famous Aswan sites you will see is generally regarded as the best. Philae Temple was carefully moved to its current location (around 500 meters from the original site) when the construction of the High Dam caused surrounding Nile waters to rise. A short motorboat ride takes you to the island, where your guide will take you on a walking tour through the temple before allowing you free time to explore further on your own.\r\n\r\nDedicated to the goddess Isis, Philae Temple has a beautiful setting on an island in the river which has been landscaped to match its original site.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing your tour, you'll be dropped off your hotel or Nile cruise in Aswan.",

You can examine each of the pyramids from outside at your pleasure, and with a little luck (there is a limited number of guests allowed inside each day) enter the chambers inside, for an extra fee. After this exploration of history, you will have a chance to see Egyptian life as it is today, in the Khan-el-Khalili bazaar.

Following a meet up with your guide, who will provide all necessary equipment, you will enjoy a local dive to get orientated, before heading to the Lara wreck, Jackson Reef, and the Sinai Peninsula.\r\n\r\nYou can receive instruction tailored for beginners, and for those with more experience. Depending on your skill level, swim through schools of fish to a spot where sharks often gather. Proceed toward the wreck Yolanda to reach a plateau 15-25 meters (50-80 feet) deep, scattered with small ergs and coral outcrops where stone fish and scorpion fish feed. The wreck of the Yolanda, complete with its cargo of toilets and baths, provides home to big fish, such as tuna, bluefish, and the occasional hammerhead.\r\n\r\nAnother popular dive site is Jackson Reef on the northernmost of the 4 reefs that separate the Sinai and Saudi Arabia. Strong currents make it ideal for large pelagic, sharks and other big fish. Admire soft and hard coral, and look for barracudas, jacks, hammerheads, and tiger sharks.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the Cypriot merchant ship Lara, which collided with the reef in 1981, lies at depths of 45 meters (147 feet) and more, while the wreck of the SS Thistlegorm holds World War II machinery and equipment, still neatly stowed in its open holds, making for a fantastic dive experience.\r\n\r\nThis most famous Sinai Peninsula dive has to be experienced to truly appreciate its wonders. The group of coral heads at Temple come up from a depth of 12-20 meters (40-65 feet). If viewed in the right position, and using your imagination, they look like columns of a temple.\r\n\r\nFor a less challenging dive, there are sandy patches at about 8 meters (25 feet) with lots of inlets into the shore reefs, and coral heads about 2 meters (6.5 feet) apart, allowing you to swim between them.",

It\u2019s still a bit of a mystery as to how the pyramids were constructed and how long they took to complete, but there\u2019s no question that the pyramids still represent the pinnacle of ancient Egyptian architectural accomplishments. The whole area, really, continues to hold many secrets yet to be uncovered, making the pyramids one of the most alluring and inviting places in the world.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhy not tick off that bucket list item, and then some, with a half-day tour to the pyramids that\u2019s going to prove to you why everyone reveres this site so much. What sets this Pyramids tour apart from the others is that you'll beat the tourists and arrive at the Giza Plateau well before the crowds and that ruthless midday sun. You'll also be treated to a local lunch! Pyramids, Sphinx, and lunch? Oh my!\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe day starts by seeing the guardian of the necropolis, the Sphinx (you know, the one with the missing nose!), which stands in front of the second Pyramid of Khepren. Enter the Giza Plateau from the Sphinx Gate to beat the crowds to the site, and after seeing the Sphinx, walk to the mysterious great pyramid of King Cheops, where you can marvel at the sheer size of the construction, and try and formulate your own theories as to how it was built.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Pyramids tour continues to the second Pyramid of Giza, which is the second largest and the only pyramid that still caries part of its original casing. From there, continue to the third and the smallest of the Giza Plateau pyramids. And no visit to the Pyramids of Giza would be complete without stopping at the panoramic view point where you get to see the all the pyramids of Giza in the one spot (and take a photo like the ones you see in travel books \u2013 free of tourists! Well, almost\u2026)\u00a0\r\n\r\nLeaving the amazing pyramids behinds, head back out to the streets of Cairo and stop by a local restaurant for lunch. You'll be treated to Koshary, a dish of rice, pasta, lentils, fried onions, and chili sauce, and a favorite amongst young local Egyptians.\u00a0After lunch, you'll be dropped back off at one of the starting points, where you can carry on your day (although the Pyramids are sure to have already been the highlight!).",
